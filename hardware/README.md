# Hardware Files

This folder contains the hardware design files for the corobos project. These files can be used for 3D printing and CAD modeling.

## Files

- `corobos.f3z`: Fusion 360 archive file for the corobos design.
- `corobos.stl`: STL file for 3D printing the corobos design.
- `corobos_plus.f3z`: Fusion 360 archive file for the corobos plus design.
- `corobos_plus.stl`: STL file for 3D printing the corobos plus design.

## Usage

### Viewing and Editing

1. **Fusion Files (`.f3z`):**

   - Open these files in Autodesk Fusion for viewing or editing the CAD models.

2. **STL Files (`.stl`):**
   - Use any 3D printing slicer to view and prepare these files for 3D printing.

### 3D Printing

1. Load the STL file into your preferred slicer software.
2. Configure the print settings according to your 3D printer's specifications.
3. Export the G-code and start the print on your 3D printer.
